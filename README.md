# galevi7-google-photos-date-organizer
The project still in process.
In general, this project was created to give a solution to a problem my wife encountered, 
she wanted to download all her photos in google-photos to hard-disk but the date that is shown in the directory you are downloading to, it's the date you downloaded it.
I'm working on bot with selenium in python that will organize it by months and will call each file by  his date so the directory can be sorted by date.
