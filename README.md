# galevi7-google-photos-date-organizer
The project still in process (**it's working** but I need time to release a proper **instructions and better UI design)** 
This project was created to give a solution to a problem in google-photos, the problem is that if you downloading photos to your computer, it shows the date the photo/video was downloaded and not when the photo were taken.
I've created a crawler with selenium in python that organize it by months and calling each file by his date so the directory can be sorted by date,
I did so with multi-processing for faster processing.
