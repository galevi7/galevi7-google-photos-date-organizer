# galevi7-google-photos-date-organizer
The project still in process (**it's working** but I need time to release a proper **instructions and better UI design)** 
In general, this project was created to give a solution to a problem my wife encountered, 
she wanted to download all her photos in google-photos to hard-disk but the date that is shown in the directory you are downloading to, it's the date you downloaded it.
I've created a crawler with selenium in python that organize it by months and calling each file by his date so the directory can be sorted by date.
